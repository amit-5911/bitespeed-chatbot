# üì¨ Message Flow System

The Message Flow System is a visual workflow tool designed to model and automate communication steps across different channels. It currently supports two types of nodes messages and emails, enabling users to define how information flows through a sequence. This tool serves as the foundation for building intelligent, multi-channel communication pipelines.

# Future Improvements for Message Flow System

1. **Add Message Providers**  
   Allow each node to specify its provider (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack, Gmail, Outlook). This enables multi-platform communication support and provider-specific configurations.

2. **Add Priority Levels**  
   Assign priorities to nodes such as `normal`, `important`, `critical`, which could influence delivery order or styling in the UI.

3. **Scheduling Support**  
   Add ability to schedule when a message/email should be sent (e.g., send at a specific date/time or after a delay).
